- The provided code is a machine learning pipeline for classifying images into 'empty' and 'not_empty' categories using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.
- The images stored in 'data-clf' directory are read, resized to 30x10 pixels, flattened into 1D arrays, and labeled accordingly. These images and labels are converted into NumPy arrays for efficient processing.
- The data is then split into training and testing sets using a stratified split to ensure similar label distribution.
- An SVM classifier is used, and 'GridSearchCV' performs hyperparameter tuning, searching over a specified grid of 'gamma' and 'C' values to find the best combination. The grid search trains multiple models with different hyperparameters on the training data and evaluates them using cross-validation.
- The best model found by the grid search is used to make predictions on the test set. The accuracy of the model is calculated by comparing the predicted labels to the true labels.
- The best-performing model is serialized and saved using the 'pickle' module for later use.
